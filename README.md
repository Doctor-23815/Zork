CS4076 - Project

My QT was facing errors half way through development so i had to reinstall and created a new project but transfered the code over to the new project however GitHub sees all those files as brand new different files and my repository was very messy because of it.

I created a folder inside this repository called "Attempt 2" with the newly updated files and was going to tidy up the rest of the repository by moving the original files into a folder called "Attempt 1" but that would cause GitHub to lose its history on those files so im leaving them in the main repository to showcase my work and how it developed over time but the finished project will be in the folder "Attempt 2".

Sorry about that.
